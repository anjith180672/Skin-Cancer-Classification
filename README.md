# Skin-Cancer-Classification

This project was implemented under the guidance of ``` Prof. Ravi Kumar Jatoth``` , ```NIT Warngal```, as a part of my ```Summer Internship```. 

### Highlights of the Project:

* Worked on detection of seven types of skin cancer using Image Processing Techniques.

* Leveraged advanced deep learning techniques (Capsnet), successfully trained a model to accurately identify and categorize skin lesions, contributing to the early detection and diagnosis of skin cancer.


## Dataset

The Dataset which is used for this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/surajghuwalewala/ham1000-segmentation-and-classification)

The following are the features of the dataset, showing whether that particular skin cancer is in the correspoding image file:

* Image_ID : The file name of an image
* AKIEC: Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinoma / Bowen's disease
* BCC : basal cell carcinoma
* BKL: benign keratosis-like lesions (solar lentigines / seborrheic keratoses and lichen-planus like keratoses, BKL)
* DF: dermatofibroma
* MEL: melanoma
* NV : melanocytic nevi
* VASC : vascular lesions (angiomas, angiokeratomas, pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage, VASC)

#### Note : Move the downloded dataset to the repository.
